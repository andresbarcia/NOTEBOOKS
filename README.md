# NOTEBOOKS

In this section you will find a collection of notebooks intended to provide a great guide to ETL and EDA processes from different examples with public Kaggle datasets as well as examples of challenges and competitions from similar websites.

My intention is not only to expose the work I have been doing but rather the learning curve in terms of programming skills and approaching ETL and EDA problems from tabular data.

Hope you can find this section interesting and usefull for furter projects you may have in mind.
