## Project

Objective:
To apply different Machine learning algorithms that can predict whether or not a person has the disease diabetes, based on the attributes used as input to the model.

Context:
We have a report where we studied a group of people and stored data on certain health indicators. The following data are labeled, we have a variable that tells us whether respondents have diabetes, do not have diabetes or have pre-diabetes.

While there is no cure for diabetes, strategies such as losing weight, eating healthy, staying active and receiving medical treatments can mitigate the damage of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models of diabetes risk important tools for the public and public health officials.
